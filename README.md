# COMS6810_Project: Advanced Topics in Computer Architecture - ISU

### Post-Quantum Cryptography for securing digital images using the FALCON algorithm (Tentative Plan):
- Medical images, using CNN and adaptive region-based to preserve the image quality, size
- 128-bits AES algorithm
- GPU-accelerated parallelization of DWT
- Lattice-based cryptography for key generation, signature, and verification
- Performance evaluation
